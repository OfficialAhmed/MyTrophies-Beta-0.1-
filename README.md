# MyTrophies-Beta-0.1-
This tool is Created by @OfficialAhmed0 for the PS4 community 
This is only a testing version, so I can get any recommendations from you guys and develop it 
for the next version which is going to be  a full GUI (Graphical User Interface) application. 
I used Python language  to read .dat file and show results based on that file.

This will work using all HEN xploit version as long as you can browse PS4 console files through FTP or PS4 Homebrew file browser
