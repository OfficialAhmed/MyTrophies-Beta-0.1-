This is how the application determine different logic

* #### User level & percentage
`assume user points = 7000`

```mermaid
graph TB
A[Subtract milestones] --Only one milestone can be subtracted with a remainder = 1000--> B(Remainder)
B --Level---> D[NO. of milestones subtracted is the 100th] --1 milestone substracted, then level >= 100 & <= 199--> V[Divide  remainder with points to level up in current level range] --1000 / 90 = 11--> d[Add-up 100th level & 11] --> Result[Level = 111 & 89% to hit level 112]
B --Percentage--> C[Divide by the next mile stone x 100] --> F[11%] --100% - 11% = 89% --> Result(Level = 111 & 89% to hit level 112)
```
